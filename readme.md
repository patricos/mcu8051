The goal of this project is to create programs utilising 8051 in various contexts.  The current list of ideas entails:

## RS232 communication
Using rs232 for transmitting bytes a PC to the MCU, and bytes transferred to be outputed on P1. 

## Real-time clock
Parametrising MCU's timers such that they can count seconds, minutes, hours.  And there is a representation of hours, minutes and seconds in some memory cells.
Feature request: set and read the clock with with rs232.

## To Be Continued
I had a few issues re-starting my 89cX051 programmer after 2-3 years idle in the lowest drawer of the farthest locker on the bottom of a damp cellar.  But finally, the programmer works!  Moreover, one 20 year old PC works too:  on it a bunch of useful ancient software packages.  I love it when the plan comes together.
